Pattern of N 
Description

You are given a number stored in a variable with the name N

You have to print all the numbers in the range from1 to N*N, such that there are exactly N numbers on each line

For example, if the value stored inN = 3, then all the numbers in the range, from [1,9] need to be printed,
such that there are 3 numbers on each line. Therefore, the required output is

1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

Input
The first and the only line of the input contains the value stored in the variable N


Output
Print all the numbers in the range from [1, N*N], as shown in the problem statement, such that there are N numbers on 
each line

4

1 2 3 4 
5 6 7 8 
9 10 11 12 
13 14 15 16 


HINT 

In the sample test case, the value stored atN = 4. 
Therefore, all the values in the range from[1,16]need to be printed.

Also, there should be 4 elements on each line. Therefore, the output becomes

1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16
