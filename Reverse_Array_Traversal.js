/*

Reverse Array Traversal 
Description

You are given an array, stored in a variable with the name arr

The size of the array is stored in a variable with the name size

You have to print the reverse traversal of the array

For example, consider the value stored in size = 4, and the array is arr = [1 2 3 4]. Then, the required output will be

4 3 2 1

Input
The first line of the input contains the value stored in size

The next line of the input contains the values stored in the array. All the values are on a single line
separated by space


Output
You have to print the reverse traversal of the array, as shown in the problem statement

Sample Input 1 
5
1 3 2 4 5

Sample Output 1
5 4 2 3 1


In the sample test case, the value stored in size = 5, and the array is given by arr = [1 3 2 4 5]

Therefore, the reverse traversal of this array will be

5 4 2 3 1
